# Android_Locatr

The app that performs a Flickr geosearch. 
It will ask for runtime permission to find your current location, and then it will use that location to look for
pictures nearby.

Doing this project I learned: 
- how to use two Play Services APIs (locations and maps), 
- how to track the user's location
- how to register for one of the Google's many web services APIs
- how to plott everything on the map
